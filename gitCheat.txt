This is a file containing basic Git commands if you are unsure how to use git on the command line.

git add <file> | adds a specific file to the staging area
git add . | adds all modified and new files to the staging area
git status | shows current state of repo, including tracked and untracked files, modified files, and branch info
git commit -m "<message>" | creates a new commit with the changes in the staging area and specifies the commit message inline
git restore <file> | restores the file to the last commit
git rm <file> | removes a file from the local dir and repo, staging the deletion.
git mv <old> <new> | moves or renames a file or directory in repo
git pull | fetches changes from the repo and merges them into the current branch
git push | pushes local commits to the repo


This will be the workflow we follow
-----------------------------------
1. pull latest changes
	- git pull origin main
2. make changes locally
3. stage and commit changes
	- git add .
	- git status
	- git commit -m "descriptive message"
4. push to github
	- git push origin main
	



don't be afraid to ask for help if you are confused or unsure. good luck!
